OPV Chainâ€™ s infrastructure has 4 layers:&#x20;

1. Ethereum layer (optional layer, not required to use): can take advantage of the high security from Ethereum when using this layer because it is implemented by a set of smart contracts on Ethereum&#x20;
2. Security layer (optional layer, not required to use): this layer provides additional security for OPV Chain and allows OPV Chain to use validators for periodically check the validity of the Chain&#x20;
3. OPV Chain layer (required layer): consists of sovereign blockchains where each network can maintain functionality: transaction reconciliation, consensus, and block production&#x20;
4. Execution layer (required layer): responsible for interpreting and executing transactions contained in the OPV Chain, it including Execution Environment and Execution Logic Sublayers
