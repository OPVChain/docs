# Proof of Stake Authority (PoSA)

Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA) is a combination of Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) and Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus mechanisms.&#x20;

OPV Chain relies on Proof-of-Staked Authority.&#x20;

DPoS is a staking model where interested parties put up a stake, or some amount of the network’s native token, in hopes of becoming a “validator”, who validate transactions and create blocks.&#x20;

The number of validators in a DPoS network is voted on by all token holders.&#x20;

P0A refers to the picking of validators by a central authority.&#x20;

The combination of DPoS and PoA helps to create a network with ultra-fast network throughput.&#x20;

OPV Chain has a block time of 5 seconds, compared to Ethereum’s 10-19 seconds block time and Bitcoin’s 10 minutes block time.
